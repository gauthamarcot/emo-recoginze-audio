The above code loads the data and extracts features using the librosa library and train a randomforest classifier model on it. It also splits the data into training and test sets. The function train_model() takes the feature and label data as input and trains the model, then it prints the accuracy of the model on the test set and returns the trained model. Finally, the main function is calling the load_data() and train_model() functions and runs the entire program.
